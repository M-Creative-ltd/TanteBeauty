## General Photography Guidelines

1. **Composition:** For square images, center your main subject as edges may be slightly cropped on different devices.

2. **Quality:** Always shoot at the highest resolution possible. Images can be compressed later, but you cannot add resolution.

3. **File Format:** 
   - Use JPG for photographs (smaller file size)
   - Use PNG for graphics, logos, or images requiring transparency

4. **Color Profile:** Use sRGB color space for web display.

5. **File Naming:** Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g., `philosophy-illustration.jpg`, `product-stoner-label.jpg`)

6. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent lighting, color grading, and style across all images within the same section for visual harmony.

## Priority Order for Photography

1. **Hero Section** (Highest priority - first impression)
2. **Product Images** (Core business content)
3. **Section Images** (Intro, Why, Philosophy, Source, Promise)
4. **Service Images** (Supporting content)
5. **Review Images** (Social proof)
6. **Contact Photo** (Supporting content)

## Notes for Photographer

- **Hero images need both landscape (desktop) and portrait (mobile) versions**
- **Review images are the only portrait-oriented (3:4) images**
- **All images should be shot with consistent lighting and color grading**
- **Consider the website's color scheme (primary: #014b3c green) when selecting backgrounds**
